# 3D Plant Facility Simulator

## Overview

Welcome to the 3D Plant Facility Simulator, an interactive application designed to enhance the first-day classroom experience for students embarking on their professional journey. This app is developed in PlayCanvas, allowing students to explore a virtual industrial plant, interact with various components, and gain early exposure to the technical aspects of their future profession.

### Key Features

- **Interactive 3D Environment**: Explore a fully simulated industrial plant with hydraulic pumps, electric motors, an electric cabin, a mixer, and valves.
- **Guided Exploration**: A central mark helps guide users, providing object descriptions and suggesting questions to ask the integrated chatbot.
- **AI-Driven Chatbot**: The chatbot answers technical questions about the plantâ€™s components, helping students understand the industrial environment better.

## Technical Architecture

The application leverages a multi-layered architecture to deliver an engaging and educational experience:

- **PlayCanvas Frontend**: The 3D environment is built using PlayCanvas, offering smooth navigation and interaction for the user.
- **Backend Integration**: Questions posed by users are sent to a Python server hosted on PythonAnywhere via Flask.
- **AI-Powered Responses**: The server processes questions using the Gemini API, which generates embeddings from a knowledge base and stores them in Pinecone vector storage. The questions are then processed using Langchain to fetch and generate the most relevant answers.
- **Continuous Learning**: The chatbot evolves over time as it interacts with users, refining its knowledge base to provide more accurate and helpful responses.

## Educational Impact

This application is specifically designed to assist instructors in introducing students to the industrial environment from day one. By simulating a real-world facility, the app bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, making technical content more accessible and engaging.
